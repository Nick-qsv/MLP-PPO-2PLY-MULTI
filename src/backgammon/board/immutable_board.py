# 4. Enhancing Episode Grouping for Clarity and Efficiency

# To improve clarity and ensure efficient processing, you might consider explicitly grouping experiences by episodes. Hereâ€™s how you can modify your implementation:
# a. Modify Memory Structure to Store Episodes Separately
# Instead of using a flat list, use a list of episodes, where each episode is a list of experiences.
# c. Adjust the Agent's Update Method to Handle Grouped Episodes
# d. Benefits of Explicit Episode Grouping
# Clarity: Clearly delineates where one episode ends and another begins, simplifying debugging and analysis.
# Flexible Processing: Facilitates more nuanced processing of episodes, such as applying episode-specific transformations or analysis.
# Enhanced Credit Assignment: Makes it easier to compute returns and advantages on a per-episode basis, ensuring accurate credit assignment even in sparse reward settings.
